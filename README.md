## Hello there
This is the 'employee management' project written entirely in cpp!
There are other files in here because I used VSC, which can be bloating but I have nonetheless decided to try it out for this project.
The .h and .cpp files of the same name correspond to each other.
Most of the .h and .cpp files are subclasses of the 'Employee' parent class, and thus contain only slight modifications besides inheriting the bulk of their properties.
